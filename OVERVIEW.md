### Key Components

#### 1. Wikipedia API Service (`lib/wikipedia.ts`)
- Handles all Wikipedia API interactions
- Implements smart caching (5 min for searches, 1 hour for details)
- Includes error handling and rate limiting considerations
- Filters results to ensure Batman relevance

#### 2. Articles List (`components/ArticlesList.tsx`)
- Main component that orchestrates the application
- Manages loading states, error handling, and data fetching
- Implements auto-refresh functionality
- Responsive grid layout

#### 3. Article Cards (`components/ArticleCard.tsx`)
- Displays individual article information
- Includes metadata like word count, size, and last updated
- Links to detailed article view
- External Wikipedia link button

#### 4. Article Detail Page (`app/article/[title]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic route for detailed article view
- Fetches full article content from Wikipedia
- Displays article images, metadata, and excerpts
- SEO optimized with proper metadata

### API Integration
- **Wikipedia Search API**: Finds Batman-related articles
- **Wikipedia REST API**: Gets detailed article information
- **CORS enabled**: All requests include proper headers
- **Error resilient**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## 🚀 How to Use Your App

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Explore Features**:

4. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### Real-time Data
Unlike static websites, your app pulls fresh content from Wikipedia continuously, ensuring users always see the latest Batman-related articles.

### Smart Filtering
The app doesn't just search for "Batman" - it uses intelligent filtering to find articles about:
- Batman characters (Bruce Wayne, Joker, etc.)
- Gotham City and Batman locations
- Batman movies, TV shows, and games
- Batman comics and storylines
- Dark Knight references

### Professional UX
- Loading skeletons during data fetching
- Error states with retry functionality
- Responsive design that works everywhere
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- SEO optimization with proper metadata

### Modern Development Practices
- TypeScript for type safety
- Server Components for performance
- Client Components where interactivity is needed
- Proper error boundaries
- Clean separation of concerns

## 🔮 Potential Enhancements

Want to extend your app? Here are some ideas:

1. **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to find specific articles
2. **Categories**: Filter articles by type (movies, comics, games)
3. **Favorites**: Let users save their favorite articles
4. **Sharing**: Add social media sharing buttons
5. **Pagination**: Load more articles on demand
6. **Article History**: Show recently viewed articles
7. **Related Articles**: Show similar articles on detail pages
